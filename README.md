# Overview
I developed a Python project to scrape YouTube data using the YouTube Data API. The project involves extracting data from YouTube channels and videos, then analyzing and visualizing the information using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.

In the first phase of the project, I gathered data on popular YouTube channels related to Data Analytics and Data Science. The key metrics I extracted included the channel name, the total number of subscribers, views, and the total number of videos posted by each channel. This data was then organized into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis, allowing for comparisons across multiple channels. The goal was to identify which channel had the highest subscriber count, the most views, and the largest number of videos. Basic visualizations were created using Seaborn to facilitate easy comparison of these metrics.

In the second phase, I focused on extracting video-specific data from the "Alex The Analyst" YouTube channel. The data collected for each video included the video title, total views, likes, and comments. This information was also loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis. Finally, simple visualizations were generated to help interpret and present the data more effectively using Seaborn.
